h1. Car Chart

Search for cars to buy graphically by charting.

When looking for second hand cars, I personally prefer to look for cars
that have low mileage and are relatively new and cheap. Currently, I search for cars
by hand and just sort by mileage, and manually weed out cars that are too old or expensive
for my tastes. This takes a lot of time.

Consider instead graphing these results. You can show mileage on one axis, price on another,
and finally color points based on their year.
Or you could graph mileage and year and size the points by price.

This is much more efficient than just looking at a list of cars. You can sort through a 
large amount of cars very quickly, and you can customize the charting to make sure
you're applying the critera that matter the most to you.

This project is a clone of the first HN reference below, except I'm starting with
CraigsList parsing, because the project below doesn't include CraigsList listings.
